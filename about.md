I started my career back in 2010 as a researcher/full-stack developer for [INESC Tecnology and Science (formerly INESCPorto)](https://www.inesctec.pt "INESCTEC's website"), developing web and desktop applications for various entities that required the R&D expertise of INESCTEC either to acquire or boost their businesses, internal processes, IT knowledge or data workflows.

I joined [TRIEDE TI](http://www.triedeti.pt "Triede TI's website")  in 2013 and have been working there since as a Senior Full Stack Developer, building rich web platforms and services with spatial context (Geographic Information Systems or GIS) for various domains, such as Port Authorities and Municipalities. 

I am a highly motivated, self-learning and passionate developer, fully able to build applications from the backend to the frontend side of things. I consider myself to be a web enthusiast, thriving to learn more, a team player and above all a people person.
